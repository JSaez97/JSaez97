<h3 align="center">A passionate Programmer from Sri lanka</h3>
<p align="center">I am fascinated by how computer technology 🌐 has brought changes to our lives that could never have been predicted; witnessing the expansion of computer science allowed me to consider studying software engineering from an early age, and my enthusiasm has perpetually developed since this time. And also I love exploring new tech stack 💻 and leveraging them to build cool stuffs 🛠️</p>
